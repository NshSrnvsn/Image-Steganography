# Image-Steganography

What is Steganography?
  
  Steganography is “an art of secret writing”. Its goal is to conceal the fact of communication. Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.
In the digital age, steganography is increasingly being used by hackers and criminals to covertly communicate sensitive information. It is even being used as a means of bypassing network defenses to communicate with malware.



Steganography Vs Crptography

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.
Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned both with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.



Terminology

In steganography the payload is the data covertly communicated and the carrier is the signal, stream, or data file that hides the payload.
